# Deploying Your Application to Amazon EKS

This guide will walk you through deploying your application to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account with necessary permissions to create EKS clusters and associated resources.
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your EKS cluster.
- Docker installed on your local machine for building container images.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Set Up Your EKS Cluster:**

   Use Terraform or the AWS Management Console to provision an EKS cluster in your AWS account. Make sure to configure the cluster with appropriate settings such as instance types, number of nodes, and networking.

2. **Deploy Your Application:**

   - Containerize your application using Docker.
   - Push the container image to a container registry like Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) or Docker Hub.
   - Write a Kubernetes deployment manifest (`deployment.yaml`) specifying your application container image, ports, environment variables, etc.
   - Apply the deployment manifest to your EKS cluster using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.

3. **Expose Your Application:**

   If your application needs to be accessible from outside the cluster:
   - Write a Kubernetes service manifest (`service.yaml`) to expose your application.
   - Apply the service manifest to your EKS cluster using `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`.

4. **Set Up Ingress Controller (Optional):**

   If you want to expose multiple services through a single entry point, consider setting up an Ingress Controller. For example, you can use NGINX Ingress Controller.
   - Deploy the Ingress Controller to your EKS cluster.
   - Configure Ingress resources to route traffic to your services.

5. **Additional Configuration (Optional):**

   Depending on your application requirements, you may need to configure other resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, Persistent Volumes, etc.

6. **Monitoring and Logging (Optional):**

   Set up monitoring and logging solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd to monitor and analyze the health and performance of your application.
